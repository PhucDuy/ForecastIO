#  How to Contribute
Thanks for taking the time to read this! As this is a hobby project for me, I don't always have the time to keep ForecastIO up to date. I try my best, but any additional help from anyone willing to contribute is very much appreciated!

## Coding Style
Take a look at the code that's already been written as a definitive guide. Comments are highly encouraged, and appledoc style is used to autogenerate documentation.

## Source Control & Pull Requests
The commit history for ForecastIO isn't the cleanest or even close to perfect, but I try to stick to a few general rules. The `master` branch is used for public releases, and each release commit is tagged with the version. Active development occurs on the `dev` branch. Once a set of commits for a feature are complete on the `dev` branch, I'll squash and merge them onto the `master` branch to keep it clean. Please send all pull requests directly to the `dev` branch. I'll review them there and make any changes that may be needed. After that, I'll merge them into `master` for a new release.

## Unit Tests
I'm proud to say that ForecastIO has 100% code coverage with unit tests! I'd like to keep it this way, and the library is pretty small so I don't think it'll be difficult to do. I highly encourage you to include unit tests with any code that you submit if applicable. Take a look at the unit tests that have already been written for a guide to write your own.

Thanks!
